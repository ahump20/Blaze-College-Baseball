# College Baseball Live - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement Addressed

ESPN has embarrassingly neglected college baseball despite it being one of only three sports that can break even or profit for athletic programs. While ESPN provides full box scores for women's college ping pong, college baseball fans only get game scores and innings with no previews or recaps.

This implementation delivers a **mobile-first college baseball tracking app** that provides the comprehensive coverage ESPN refuses to give.

3. **Conference Standings**
   - Real-time conference records

```

#### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `/api/college-baseball/games` - Live and scheduled games
- **Endpoint**: `/api/college-baseball/boxscore` - Detailed game stats
- **Endpoint**: `/api/college-baseball/standings` - Conference standings
- **Caching**: Intelligent KV caching (30s live, 5m standings, 1h final)
- **Data Format**: Standardized JSON responses with success/error handling

#### Mobile-First Approach
- **Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: < 768px (default, optimized)
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px
  - Desktop: > 1024px
- **Navigation**: Bottom nav on mobile, top nav on desktop
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for accessibility
- **Scrolling**: Horizontal scroll for tables on mobile
