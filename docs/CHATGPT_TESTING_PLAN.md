# 🤖 ChatGPT Agent Mode - Next-Gen Features Testing Plan

**Project**: Blaze Sports Intelligence Platform
**URL**: https://blazesportsintel.com/analytics
**Testing Agent**: ChatGPT Agent Mode (Browser Capable)
**Requesting Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5) - Cannot browse/interact with UI
**Date Created**: 2025-10-09
**Test Duration**: ~15-20 minutes for comprehensive testing

---

## 🎯 Mission Overview

You are testing **6 next-generation sports analytics features** that were implemented by Claude Code but are currently **disabled by default** using feature flags. Your mission is to:

1. **Enable each feature** via browser console
2. **Visually verify** it renders correctly
3. **Test interactions** (clicks, hovers, toggles)
4. **Check for errors** in browser console
5. **Report findings** back to Claude Code

**Why ChatGPT?** Claude Code cannot open browsers or interact with web UIs. You have browser capabilities that Claude lacks - you can see the actual page, click buttons, and verify visual rendering.

## 📊 What We Built (Context)

### Implementation Summary
- **Total Code**: ~2,400 lines of production React components
- **Deployment**: Live on Cloudflare Pages at blazesportsintel.com/analytics
- **Safety Mechanism**: All features wrapped in ErrorBoundary + feature flags
- **Current State**: All flags set to `false` (disabled) - zero production risk
- **Goal**: Verify features work before enabling for public users

### The 6 Features

| Phase | Feature | What It Does | Sample/Real Data |
|-------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **2** | Real-Time Dashboard | 6-card grid with live games, standings, quick stats, auto-refresh | Sample |
| **3** | MLB Statcast | xBA, barrel rate, attack angles, spray charts | Sample |
| **4** | NFL Next Gen Stats | 10Hz tracking, completion probability, coverage responsibility | Sample |
| **5** | AI Predictions | LSTM injury risk + XGBoost performance forecasting | Sample |
| **6a** | Plotly WebGPU | Million-point dataset visualization with GPU acceleration | Sample |
| **6b** | deck.gl Heatmaps | GPU-accelerated geospatial visualizations | Sample |

**Note**: All features currently use **sample data**. We're testing the UI/UX, not data accuracy.

## 🎯 Recommendation

Based on testing, I recommend:

- [ ] **Option 2: Proceed with Gradual Rollout**
  - All features work correctly
  - Ready for Week 1 (enable Real-Time Dashboard on Monday)
  - Follow 3-week rollout plan in `docs/NEXTGEN_ROLLOUT_GUIDE.md`

- [ ] **Option 3: Build Real APIs First**
  - Features work but sample data feels too fake
  - Need production endpoints before public launch
  - Implement real MLB Statcast, NFL Next Gen, ML prediction APIs

- [ ] **Fix Critical Bugs First**
  - Found blocking issues that need immediate fix
  - List critical bugs: [Bug 1], [Bug 2], [Bug 3]
  - Re-test after fixes before any rollout

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Watch For

### Blocking Issues (Report Immediately)
- ❌ Page crashes or becomes unresponsive
- ❌ Console flooded with errors (>10 errors)
- ❌ Features don't appear even after enabling flags
- ❌ Browser freezes or memory leak (>500MB)
- ❌ ErrorBoundary displays error messages

### Major Issues (Should Fix Before Rollout)
- ⚠️ Visualizations don't render (blank canvas)
- ⚠️ Buttons don't respond to clicks
- ⚠️ Data shows as "NaN" or "undefined"
- ⚠️ Mobile layout completely broken
- ⚠️ Significant performance lag (>5s load time)

### Minor Issues (Can Fix During Rollout)
- 🔸 Slight animation jank
- 🔸 Minor styling inconsistencies
- 🔸 Unclear labels or tooltips
- 🔸 Sample data obviously fake

---

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions (If Testing Goes Wrong)

If the page breaks during testing:

```javascript
// Instant rollback - disable all features
FEATURE_FLAGS.realTimeDashboard = false;
FEATURE_FLAGS.mlbStatcast = false;
FEATURE_FLAGS.nflNextGenStats = false;
FEATURE_FLAGS.aiPredictions = false;
FEATURE_FLAGS.plotlyWebGPU = false;
FEATURE_FLAGS.deckGLVisualization = false;
location.reload();
```

This returns the page to original working state immediately.

- ✅ Capture screenshots for documentation
- ✅ Provide human-like UX feedback

**Your testing complements Claude's programmatic verification.** Together, we ensure the features work perfectly before public launch.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Testing is successful when:

1. **All 6 features render visually** without errors
2. **Interactions work smoothly** (clicks, toggles, animations)
3. **Console shows 0 errors** during full integration test
4. **Performance is acceptable** (<5s load, <200MB memory)
5. **You can provide clear recommendation** on Option 2 vs Option 3
