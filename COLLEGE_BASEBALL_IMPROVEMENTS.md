## Overview
This document outlines improvements made to blazesportsintel.com based on the Strategic Assessment document analyzing the college baseball market opportunity.

## Key Insights from Strategic Assessment

### Market Size

### Fan Pain Points
1. **ESPN's Poor Mobile Experience**: Fans consistently complain ESPN's app is "terrible" for college baseball
