## Email Management Best Practices

- **Action**: Move to folder `Blaze Legal` and mark as important

- **Condition**: To address contains `privacy@blazesportsintel.com`
- **Action**: Move to folder `Blaze Privacy` and mark as important

**Support Rule:**
- **Condition**: To address contains `support@blazesportsintel.com`
- **Action**: Move to folder `Blaze Support`

## DNS Records Verification

After enabling Email Routing, verify these DNS records are present:

```bash
# Check MX records
dig MX blazesportsintel.com

# Expected output:
blazesportsintel.com.  300  IN  MX  1 route1.mx.cloudflare.net.
blazesportsintel.com.  300  IN  MX  2 route2.mx.cloudflare.net.
blazesportsintel.com.  300  IN  MX  3 route3.mx.cloudflare.net.

# Check SPF record
dig TXT blazesportsintel.com

# Expected output should include:
"v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net ~all"
```

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Enable 2FA on Outlook Account

Since all emails forward to `ahump20@outlook.com`, secure this account:

1. Go to [Microsoft Account Security](https://account.microsoft.com/security)
2. Enable **Two-step verification**
3. Add authenticator app (Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator)
4. Save backup codes in a secure location

### 2. Monitor for Phishing

Be cautious of emails claiming to be from:
- Users requesting data deletion (verify identity first)
- Fake DMCA notices (verify copyright holder legitimacy)
- Security researchers (verify through responsible disclosure platforms)

### 3. Encryption

For sensitive communications (privacy requests, legal notices):
- Consider using ProtonMail or Tutanota for encrypted responses
- Or use PGP encryption with your existing Outlook account

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Being Received

1. **Check Cloudflare Email Routing status**:
   - Dashboard → Email → Email Routing → **Enabled** (green)
   - Destination address: **Verified** (green checkmark)

2. **Check DNS propagation**:
   ```bash
   dig MX blazesportsintel.com
   # Should show route1.mx.cloudflare.net, route2.mx.cloudflare.net, route3.mx.cloudflare.net
   ```

3. **Check Outlook spam folder**:
   - Forwarded emails may initially be flagged as spam
   - Mark as "Not Spam" and add blazesportsintel.com to safe senders

4. **Check Cloudflare Email Routing logs**:
   - Dashboard → Email → Email Routing → **Activity**
   - View delivery status for each email

### Emails Being Marked as Spam

1. **Add SPF and DKIM records** (Cloudflare does this automatically)
2. **Add DMARC record** for additional authentication:
   ```
   Name: _dmarc.blazesportsintel.com
   Type: TXT
   Value: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@blazesportsintel.com
   ```

3. **Warm up the domain**:
   - Start with low email volume
   - Gradually increase over 2-4 weeks
   - Avoid sudden spikes in outbound emails
