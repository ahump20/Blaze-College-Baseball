# Strategic Assessment Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes how we've implemented improvements to blazesportsintel.com based on the Strategic Assessment: Launching a College Baseball-Focused Sports App document.

## Key Findings from Strategic Assessment

### Market Opportunity
The Strategic Assessment identified a significant underserved market:

- **2.82M viewers** for 2024 MCWS finals (competing against NHL Stanley Cup Game 7)
- **3.34M viewers** for peak MCWS game
- **29.5M households** reached during 2022 MCWS
- **$10M+ annual revenue** for top college baseball programs

### Critical Pain Points Identified
The assessment revealed specific frustrations with existing solutions:

1. **ESPN's "Terrible" App**: Fans consistently complain about poor college baseball coverage
