# College Baseball Live - The App ESPN Won't Build

## Overview

College Baseball Live is a mobile-first web application designed to provide comprehensive coverage of college baseball - a sport that has been embarrassingly neglected by major sports platforms like ESPN. While ESPN provides full box scores and updated player stats for women's college ping pong, college baseball fans are left with just game scores and innings, with no previews or recaps.

This app addresses that gap by providing:

âœ… **Full Box Scores** - Complete batting and pitching statistics for every game  
âœ… **Live Game Tracking** - Real-time updates with current pitcher, batter, and game situation  
âœ… **Conference Standings** - Up-to-date standings with RPI rankings  
âœ… **Mobile-First Design** - Optimized for on-the-go consumption on phones  
âœ… **SEC Focus** - Special attention to Texas, LSU, and other SEC powerhouses  

## Why This Matters

College baseball is one of only three sports that can break even or profit for athletic departments (along with football and basketball). Yet it receives almost no digital coverage compared to other sports. When ESPN does cover college baseball, it's typically just one highlight clip from LSU or Texas making a flashy play.

This app is built for fans who are tired of:
- No game previews or recaps
- Limited player statistics
- No comprehensive standings or team information
- Being ignored by major sports platforms
